# SHINY HUNTING

It works only with vba rr 23.6.
New versions and other emulator in progress.

I recommend don't speed up your emulator or some scripts are going 
to work wrong.

Inside of each foder are going to be a small video showing how it would look executed

## FISHING BOTS ##

Select your rod, put cursor over "USE" and run the script.

Inside of each fishing script are a option called OP, if you initialize 
this local variable to 7 you are going to see the DVs of every Soft Reset Pokemon.
